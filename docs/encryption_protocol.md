# Encrypted Payloads

BlueBubbles clients now encrypt socket payloads on a per-chat basis. Each client generates an elliptic curve key pair and performs an ECDH key exchange to derive a shared secret for the chat.

Outgoing socket messages include the following fields:

- `chatGuid`: identifies the conversation whose key should be used.
- `data`: base64 AES-GCM encrypted JSON payload.
- `encrypted`: `true` when the payload is encrypted.

Servers should decrypt incoming data using the current session key for the provided chat and reâ€‘encrypt responses using the same key. Session keys are rotated whenever a new conversation is created or when group participants change.
