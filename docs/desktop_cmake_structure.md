# Desktop CMake Structure

Flutter's desktop platforms (Linux and Windows) use generated build files that live in an `ephemeral/` directory. This directory is created by the Flutter tool and is excluded from version control.

Each platform's `flutter/CMakeLists.txt` file includes the generated configuration from `flutter/ephemeral/generated_config.cmake` and then defines the remaining static build rules required by the project.

The historical TODO to migrate these rules to generated files (flutter/flutter#57146) has been resolved. The current structure is:

```
linux/
  flutter/
    CMakeLists.txt        # Project-specific rules; includes `ephemeral/`
    ephemeral/            # Generated by Flutter; not checked in

windows/
  flutter/
    CMakeLists.txt        # Project-specific rules; includes `ephemeral/`
    ephemeral/            # Generated by Flutter; not checked in
```

Future maintenance:
- Modify the respective `CMakeLists.txt` files for manual changes.
- Generated artifacts inside `flutter/ephemeral` are recreated by the Flutter tool and should not be committed.
